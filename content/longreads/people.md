I started this list originally [in my blog](https://marcus.io/blog/web-app-a11y-folks) in order to collect folks and projects that are worth checking out when it comes to web-app accessibility. Being totally aware that it is most definitely incomplete: in case you know of any other people, projects and initiatives, [contribute to this list via GitHub](https://github.com/accessible-app/accessible-app_com/edit/master/content/longreads/people.md), or [drop me a line via e-mail](mailto:a11yapp@marcus-herrmann.com)!


### React

* There's Ryan Florence [Reach UI](https://reach.tech) project - its aim is to become the accessible foundation of your React-based design system.
* Tenon UI follows the same goal and is created by [Almero Steyn](http://almerosteyn.com) and [Job van Achterberg](https://twitter.com/detonite)
* Hugo Giraudel is currently working on the N26 online banking web app [(read my interview with Hugo here)](https://marcus.io/blog/interview-with-hugo-giraudel-of-n26) and writing about it: [on their blog](https://hugogiraudel.com/), on [twitter](https://twitter.com/HugoGiraudel) and at [conferences](https://hugogiraudel.com/speaking/).
* [The Australian Government opensourced their design system](https://designsystem.gov.au/) (MIT Licence) and supplies HTML samples, extensive accessibility meta data (Color impairment simulation, Keyboard tabbing simulation, typical mobile and desktop screen reader output...) - and last but not least ready-made accessible React components ([direct link to their GitHub repo.](https://github.com/govau/design-system-components/))
* [Scott Vinkle](https://twitter.com/svinkle/) has created an [inclusive React Demo App](https://tv-db.net/) ([Source code]( https://github.com/svinkle/tv-db)) and wrote the article "[Creating accessible React Apps](https://medium.com/@svinkle/creating-accessible-react-apps-38dc1c2775cf)"
* Starting January 17th, 2019 you can add Marcy Sutton to the React side of things. In her past she helped the Angular project's accessibility


### Vue

* [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/) is based on Google's Material Design System which supplies a solid accessible foundation for Vue components
* Alan Ktquez, Callum McRae, Victoria Bergquist and others have started the [vue-a11y](https://vue-a11y.com) project and, until the time of writing, released [vue-axe](https://github.com/vue-a11y/vue-axe), [vue announcer](https://github.com/vue-a11y/vue-announcer) and [vue skipto](https://github.com/vue-a11y/vue-skip-to).
* [Maria Lamardo](https://twitter.com/MariaLamardo) teaches a course about accessibility on VueSchool.io
* [Oscar Braunert](https://twitter.com/_ovlb) gives [great talks](https://talks.ovl.design/) and starts great projects regarding accessibility in Vue (on of them is [tournant UI](https://ui.tournant.dev))
* [Austin Gil](https://twitter.com/Stegosource) built [vuetensils](https://github.com/Stegosource/vuetensils), a helper component library with accessibility in mind.
* [VueVixens](https://www.vuevixens.org/) offer a half day workshop called "Build an Accessible Memory Game". Anyone interested could read all of its structure and contents, and find all necessary code on a [dedicated page](https://workshops.vuevixens.org/workshop/half-day/half-day1.html#what-you-ll-build).

### Angular

(I must confess, I have no overview of the angular a11y world, so I can only present the one Angular finding in my "accessibility" bookmarks)

* I stumbled upon an extensive article from [Matt Moore](https://mattdoescode.com/) called [Angular Accessibility and you](https://blog.dinolytics.com/2018/10/25/angular-accessibility-and-you/)

### Ember.js
* [Melanie Sumner](https://twitter.com/melaniersumner) is an EmberJS core member, works for LinkedIn and focuses on the development of better accessibility tooling for JavaScript developers.

### General

* Heydon Pickering, of course. Although saying he *just* writes about accessibility of modern JavaScript would be an understatement. He has a specialized [blog](http://inclusive-components.design/) and [ebook](http://book.inclusive-components.design/) about building inclusive components, though.
* Emiliy Mears both writes about inclusive strategies for React and Vue on [Medium](https://medium.com/@emilymears)
* Rob Dodson, who published, among other things the great [a11ycasts](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNYkxOF6rcICWx0C9LVWWVqvHlYJyqw7g) video series, which has a large overlap with the accessibility of web apps
* [Deque](https://deque.com) has to ressources:
    * [Cauldron](https://pattern-library.dequelabs.com/  ) - "A fully accessible HTML, CSS, and Javascript front-end framework for creating web and mobile applications". Since [React support is coming soon](https://twitter.com/caitlinthefirst/status/1085910704941613057) I will move Cauldron to the React section, once it hits the shelves
    * An [ARIA Widget Library](https://dequeuniversity.com/resources/), over at the Deque Academy, which is also highly recommended for educational reasons
* [Lindsey Kopacz](https://www.a11ywithlindsey.com/) is currently preparing an online course about JavaScript and accessibility - something of which there is still too little at the moment. [If you want to stay informed about when the course launches, subscribe to her newsletter](https://twitter.us12.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=f3d8a4a93db24975a2da9565b&id=6a007d2435).
* [Suzanne Aitchison](https://mobile.twitter.com/s_aitchison) runs [upyoura11y](https://www.upyoura11y.com/) (I love a good pun!) where she offers <q>tutorials and resources for developers seeking to build accessible web experiences</q>. Currently it has a focus on React. I think it is a good complement to the current (involuntary) focus on Vue.js on [accessible-app.com](https://accessible-app.com)!
